# fetch-ec2-tags

In this script, you will provide the tag key as an input when prompted. The script will then fetch the value of the specified tag for each IP address. This way, you can reuse the script to fetch any tag's value by simply providing the tag key.

Replace # List of IP addresses with the actual list of IP addresses you want to use.

To run the script:

Open AWS CloudShell.
Copy and paste the script into the shell.
Press Enter to run the script.
Provide the tag key when prompted.
Provide a list of IP addresses separated by new lines for the ips list.
Make sure you have the necessary permissions and AWS credentials configured in CloudShell before running the script.
